>I share monitors between systems using x2x. How will this work under Wayland?
>Screen sharing with Wayland is in the preliminary stages. Currently, the most progress has been made in Chromium where pipewire and xdg-desktop-portal can be leveraged for screen sharing in WebRTC. With these packages installed, WebRTC PipeWire support must still be enabled in the Chromium flags, as can be found by entering in the address bar: chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-capturer
